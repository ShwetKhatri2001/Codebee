# CodeBee

* Learn data structures and algorithms through creative visualizations and real-time doubt clearance.

* The New Education policy 2021 has opened up the field of Computer Science to young coders. I realized that beginning with coding is tough for even a college-level beginner. Although there are lot of free materials, but everything that is organized is paid.

* Also, the content is not designed for secondary school students. Therefore I came up with this innovation to provide students with free-of-cost study materials. Kids can learn logic, structure, sequence, and creative expression just as having fun around.  

* Developer Days --> Web Development Track --> Final Challenge Submission

## Installation

First these commands and follow mentioned steps to get your app ready with installation.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ShwetKhatri2001/Codebee.git
```

```bash
npm install 
```

```bash
cd client
npm install 
```

After installations, make a `.env` file in root directory and add some env variables there . 
* Add backend port number as `PORT`, client domain as `DOMAIN_NAME`, api url as `API_URL`, mongodb url as `MONGO_URI`
  and `NODE_ENV` having value development / production.
* Then we need `SENDGRID_VERIFIED_MAIL` and `SENDGRID_API_KEY` to get email service from sendgrid.
* Then add some secret strings as `CRYPTO_SECRET` and `JWT_SECRET`.
* At last in this file add Github auth secret key and id as `CLIENT_SECRET` and `CLIENT_ID`. 

Now make a `.env` file in client directory and add similar values given in backend env for `REACT_APP_DOMAIN_NAME` and `REACT_APP_API_URL` and add `REACT_APP_SAWO_API_KEY` for sawo passwordless authentication.

To run you app, use this command.

```bash
npm run dev
```
